        Hello! I am Joel Foessett, being able to work on this project gave me a <br>
        good feelings about working in a group on a project in a semi-real life <br>
        setting.  The people on this class were excited to jump right in and that <br>
        feeling was contagious!

        Hello and thank you for visiting BrewHub, the finest brewery listing site around!<br>
        I was responsible for implementing the API for the site using Node.js, render.com, and the PostgreSQL database provided by the team.<br>
        Pictured above is my co-developer working on something very important, probably.
